<br>Legs are for mounting bottom panels (like mine) using the feet holes (lol). This requires taller legs so there is no gap between the panels and the legs. Normally you would need 55mm+ M3 screws for this, but they are not common so I designed these to use 16mm M3 to attach to the extrusions, and a threaded insert with 12mm M3 screws for the feet+panel. You will need a ball-end driver for the internal M3 screws.

<br>Nuttraps are for getting rid of the annoying M2 nuttraps used in the v0 printers. It is a metal panel that has M2 (you need to tap them after laser cutting) screws in MGN7 spacing. I used 1.5mm aluminium.
<br>
<br>Panels are the for fully enclosing the v0.1 and replacing the solid v0.1 panels with different ones. Internal ones feature mounting holes for a duet wifi, a raspberry pi, the buck converter and the meanwell psu (BOM one). They don't work with the mini pocketwatch. External ones should work for all builds. They need to be 3mm thick, I used aluminium laser-cut panels.

Tophat is my new custom tophat design. It is a square shaped extension on the top using 3D printed 15*15 parts (extrusion sized). Also includes LED mounting and a camera mount for a cheap [Aliexpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_9xBGzb) webcam ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/2YGUBq3)). Requires larger acrylic panels and other laser cut aluminium panels.
